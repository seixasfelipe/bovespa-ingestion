# Changelog

## Version 0.4.0 (yanked)

- Added environment variable `test` when running `rake`.

- Translated code base to english.

### Changes that are NOT backwards compatible

- Database tables must be droped because we have replaced old portuguese migrations by english ones!

- If you already had any data, just re-import it, sorry for that but It had to be that way.
